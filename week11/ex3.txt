In the first example, the string is saved in the buffer, and when the program forks, 
the new process gets THE SAME buffer. And when both processes output the newline character,
the data from the buffer is written to standard io stream. 

In the second example, the data from the buffer is written right away because of 
the newline character present in the first printf statement. So when the program forks, the buffer 
is clear and both parent and child processes output just a new line.
